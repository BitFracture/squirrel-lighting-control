# PCF8591 Driver for Arduino

The PCF8591 is an 8-bit analog IO chip with 4 input channels and one output channel. Unlike a PWM signal, this chip features a digital potentiometer, and sets the voltage level of the output pin. 

While the PCF8591 inputs can be used as a comparison, this driver only reads the four channels independently. 

## Getting Started

Define an instance of Pcf8591 and pass it the TwoWire instance to use. This way you may still use TwoWire (I2C) for other things, and you may configure which pins the Pcf8591 can be found on. 

```
#include <Pcf8591.h>

Pcf8591 analogIO(Wire);
```

Initialize the built-in Wire instance by providing it ports to communicate on.

```
void setup() {
    Wire.begin(4, 5);
}
```

Begin writing from and reading to the chip. Note that `write()` and `read()` both take a chip number as its argument. Your Pcf8591 chips have 3 pins reserved for address selecting. This allows the chip number to be 0 through 7. Please choose the appropriate chip number when calling write or read.

```
void loop() {
    //Read input 3 from chip 0
    uint8_t input3 = analogIO.read(0, 3);
    //Read input 1 from chip 0
    uint8_t input3 = analogIO.read(0, 1);
	//Write output of 222 to chip 0
    analogIO.write(0, 222);
	//Write output of 12 to chip 5
    analogIO.write(5, 12);
}
```

The output levels when using `write()` are vRef * (value / 255). In other words, your available range of 0 to 255 for output correspond to voltage levels 0V to ARef.
